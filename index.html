				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project is an application that help patients who have communication and speech disorders specialty who live in rural or who can't come to the doctor every time or at all. Also, this application will help the doctors and will make them more organized. This app will help patients to do everything they want online. They will not need to come to the doctor every time. Also, they will attend all their appointments in their home. which will let patients get any therapist they want in the whole world.  this project will help many patients in the whole world. This application will be made in IOS programming.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>My friend is a speech therapist, and he always talks to me about his patients who have communication and speech disorders. Most of them live in rural areas where there are no therapists. People from these areas usually do not show improvement in their conditions. The reason behind that is the treatment needs discipline, practice, seeing the therapist regularly to assess the condition and make the right plan to get better. However, because they cannot come to their appointments regularly. They face difficulties to come travel for long hours every week or a couple times a month. Therefore, they usually miss appointments and postpone them. Also, some patients can't go to the therapist. this project will help them all, and it will help the therapist.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Based on that problem I have thought about this issue a lot until I got a solution that might greatly help my friend and his patient and all the therapists, patients, and patients’ families. After a lot of thinking, I get an idea about how to solve it by this IOS application. iOS application for children and people who have speech and communication difficulties. By using this app, the patients and their family can reduce the need to travel to their therapist regularly to see their therapist only 1 or 2 times a year depending on their situation. Also, sometimes they don't need that at all. The application should have a list of therapists, their places and their rating. therefore, everyone could choose any doctor they want, and they can know the nearest doctor and his rating which will make them chose easily.  Also, the application should also have all the patient reports, so they or their parents can see it online. In addition, it will help the doctor to review patients improves and, it will make him/her more organized. Also, it might contain a tab where the patient can book an online / face-to-face appointment with their therapist, and the patients will not need to come to the doctor every time the need to book appointment. Also, the app should contain a variety of exercises to practice based on the patient's age and condition. For example, a game where the children listen to a fruit or animals name after that he choose it from the picture. Also, it should contain some games where the person can listen to a series of orders and do them respectively, such as “press the yellow circle. Then, drag the blue square to the empty square”. Beside these exercises, they could have a short story and a recording button to hold while reading the story. these games have a level which will make him interest, and make the therapist see how the patients are improved easily. Also, every therapist can recommend idea of games that will help the patients to be better and send it to the developer of this application.  the idea of these game is that it will record the patient's voice and analyse it by using a speech analysis algorithm and the result and the record will be sent to their therapist to analyse their progress while they are in their house. Also, the application should have a video call which will make the therapist talk to the patients if he or the patient need that. The idea of that it will help the patient's parents need to talk with their child's doctor and know his or her improving, or if they don't understand something. In addition, it will help the therapist if he wants to talk to the patients and see how they are moving their mouth and tongue which will give him idea about how to treat them.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>This application is specialized to help the patients how have speech and communication disorders. It doesn’t need a lot of tools and technology. therefore, to design the exercises, games and stories. we need a theorbist who are specialised in this field. They will need a devise that use IOS such us, iPhone or iPad. Also, they will need the internet concoction. After a while, maybe the application will be designed in android.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The application is narrowed to a sensitive field, which is helping patients who have speech and communication disorders. Therefore, it is important to design the app carefully in a proper way that ensures the benefit to the patients and their families. Thus, It is crucial to have specialists in this field during the app development period because they know how to design the proper games, exercises, and stories in the best way that helps to use the app in the treatment journey and gain the best results</p>
